Want to mess around with making a software rasterizer. Don't really know what I'm doing. Going to try to follow along with TinyRenderer: https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki

GOOD IDEA: upload images of things being generated periodically into this readme so I can look back and see how the project progressed!
